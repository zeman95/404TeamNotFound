Science and Engineering Practices:
1_LP1of7Notepad.txt: 2.  Teacher records student responses on the board to the guiding question. (Modeled)
1_LP1of7Notepad.txt: 4. Share with students that Omaha area receives their water from 3 sources: Missouri river, Platte river, and Dakota sandstone aquifer. An aquifer is an area underground that holds water in the gaps between rock, sand or gravel. Sort of like an underground lake or stream. Other parts of the state receive water from the Ogallala aquifer and other groundwater sources. (5 min). (Modeled)
1_LP1of7Notepad.txt: 5. Prompt students to think about if they’ve ever learned anything about the water cycle. In this unit we will be defining what our Earth’s water cycle does. (1-2 min) (Modeled)
1_LP1of7Notepad.txt: 6. Explain to students that over the course of the unit they will be working in small groups to develop a game about what they are learning about the water cycle. Each day groups will develop engaging questions based off of what they’ve learned that day. By the end of the unit each game will have at least 16 questions: 8 about the water on the local level and 8 about the water cycle on a global level. Today they will begin creating their game boards. Share different layouts from games in your classroom or look some up online. For example: Monopoly, Chutes and Ladders, Sorry!, etc. (10 min) (Modeled)
1_LP1of7Notepad.txt: 7. Students will receive time to work on their gameboard formats. (30 min) (Independent)
2_LP2of7Notepad.txt: 1. Ask students to consider the question: “How does the Missouri River, Platte River, and the Dakota Sandstone Aquifer maintain its water level if major cities like Omaha and Kansas City are constantly removing large amounts daily?” Use the Kagan activity stand up, hand up, pair up and have students share their answers to the guiding question. (2 min) (Modeled)
2_LP2of7Notepad.txt: 4. Teacher will explain that students will be doing a quick walkabout to gain some “knowledge drops” about M.U.D.(Metropolitan Utilities District) and how it supports Omaha. Explain to students that during the walkabout they will learn a lot of information. Their job is to take a post it note and a pencil and record the “knowledge drop” they found to be most interesting and why. (2-3 min) (Modeled)
2_LP2of7Notepad.txt: 6. Introduce that we will be learning about the water cycle. Today we will build a model that will mimic several parts of the water cycle. Over the course of the next few classes we will observe how the model mimics several parts of the water cycle. (2-3 min) (Modeled)
2_LP2of7Notepad.txt: 7. Teacher will divide students into ability groups of 3-4 students. Guide students through creating a model environment. (see eScience3000 Earth’s Waters Unit, Chapter 1-The Water Planet, Lesson 1: The Water Cycle Investigate tab for complete directions)  (30 min.) (Guided)
2_LP2of7Notepad.txt: 8. Students will respond on post-its or padlet what they think they will observe in the models they built. (5 min) 
2_LP2of7Notepad.txt: 9. Once students have put their water cycle models together, they will continue working on their game boards. (Varies)
3_LP3of7Notepad.txt: 1. Teacher instructs students to meet in their small groups to record observations they observe within their water cycle models. Students have not received any vocabulary words or any direct instruction about the water cycle, so their observations will be informal. (5 min) (Modeled)
3_LP3of7Notepad.txt: 3. Formally introduce the key terms evaporation, condensation, precipitation, transpiration, crystallization, respiration, decomposition and groundwater. Students will need to model how to write a definition for students. Teacher will model using the words respiration and decomposition for students as they will not observe these within their models.  Ask students if they think they observed any of these terms in their model.  Are there any that aren’t? Why not?(5 min) (Modeled)
3_LP3of7Notepad.txt: 4. While still in their small groups students will try to form their own definitions of the key terms in their journals. They should use what they learned in the study jams video as well as what they observe in their models. (10 min) (Shared)
3_LP3of7Notepad.txt: 6. Teacher introduces expectations for participating in an academic conversation. Explain to students that when we have academic conversations we discuss science topics in a deeper way. While engaging in the conversation students will add their thinking using what they know and facts that they’ve learned. When we engage in an academic conversation we need to keep the following in mind (these may need to be elaborated on): (10 min) - take turns - stay on topic - express ideas clearly - listen actively - build on others’ comments/thinking - be respectful(i agree with/disagree with...because) - allow for wait time - be prepared (Modeled)
3_LP3of7Notepad.txt: 9. Explain that we are going to investigate how different materials that make up Earth’s surface can affect how water moves when it comes in contact with the ground. *Earth’s materials is a general term that includes minerals, rocks, soil, and water. These are naturally occurring materials found on Earth that constitute the raw materials upon which our global society exists. Earth materials are vital resources that provide the basic components for life, agriculture, and industry. (2-3 min) (Modeled)
3_LP3of7Notepad.txt: 12. After students have finished their investigations, remind students that humans are using large amounts sometimes up to 70% of the water contained in the ground for activities such as irrigation. Ask students if they think this is a good idea?(1 min) (Modeled)
3_LP3of7Notepad.txt: 14. After the completion of the groundwater activity, students should take out their journals. Here the class will brainstorm what they learned about the key terms. Together the class will draw an example water cycle diagram based off of student provided answers. For example, students might say they see evaporation of puddles on the sidewalk after it rains. This would then be drawn and labeled in their journals. (15 min) (Shared)
3_LP3of7Notepad.txt: 17. At the end of class students will meet in their small groups to begin developing questions for their game based on today’s lesson. They may need additional support in how to create questions. (teacher discretion) (Independant)

Disciplinary Core Ideas:
1_LP1of7Notepad.txt: 1.  To generate interest in the topic, present the guiding question: “where does the water we use daily in Omaha come from?” (2-3 min) (Shared)
1_LP1of7Notepad.txt: 3.  Ask students if they would want to drink or use the water from the Missouri river. Ask students to turn and talk to their shoulder partner.  (Shared)

(2 min) (Modeled)
2_LP2of7Notepad.txt: 5. Students go on the walkabout and complete their post it leaving the post it underneath the “knowledge drop” they found most interesting. Students will do a “Did you Know?” walkabout with the following facts: Metropolitan Utilities District of Omaha serves more than 214,000 customers an average of about 90 million gallons of water per day. We also maintain 27,275 hydrants for fire protection. The average M.U.D. residential customer uses 85,000 gallons of water per year.  The cost for 85,000 gallons in 2017 is $362.42 including service fee, $4 infrastructure replacement charge and 2-percent payment to cities. (10 min.) (Independant)

3_LP3of7Notepad.txt: 10. Have students complete the “read” section of eScience Unit 3 Earth’s Waters Chapter 1 The Water Planet Lesson 3 Groundwater in pairs while teacher supports small groups as needed for students that need additional reading supports. (30 min) (Shared)
3_LP3of7Notepad.txt: 11. Students will complete the “investigation” portion of the eScience3000 lesson found eScience3000 Unit 3 Earth’s Waters Chapter 1 The Water Planet Lesson 3 Groundwater. Guide students through the investigation. As students complete the investigation they will begin to see that water filters through certain materials. Provide the prompt: What is the force that pulls water down into the ground? Students should eventually come to the conclusion that gravity pulls water down. (40 min) (Guided)
