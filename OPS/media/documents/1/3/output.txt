1_LP1of7Notepad.txt: 4. Share with students that Omaha area receives their water from 3 sources: Missouri river, Platte river, and Dakota sandstone aquifer. An aquifer is an area underground that holds water in the gaps between rock, sand or gravel. Sort of like an underground lake or stream. Other parts of the state receive water from the Ogallala aquifer and other groundwater sources. (5 min). (Modeled)
1_LP1of7Notepad.txt: 5. Prompt students to think about if they’ve ever learned anything about the water cycle. In this unit we will be defining what our Earth’s water cycle does. (1-2 min) (Modeled)
1_LP1of7Notepad.txt: 6. Explain to students that over the course of the unit they will be working in small groups to develop a game about what they are learning about the water cycle. Each day groups will develop engaging questions based off of what they’ve learned that day. By the end of the unit each game will have at least 16 questions: 8 about the water on the local level and 8 about the water cycle on a global level. Today they will begin creating their game boards. Share different layouts from games in your classroom or look some up online. For example: Monopoly, Chutes and Ladders, Sorry!, etc. (10 min) (Modeled)
1_LP1of7Notepad.txt: 7. Students will receive time to work on their gameboard formats. (30 min) (Independent)
2_LP2of7Notepad.txt: 1. Ask students to consider the question: “How does the Missouri River, Platte River, and the Dakota Sandstone Aquifer maintain its water level if major cities like Omaha and Kansas City are constantly removing large amounts daily?” Use the Kagan activity stand up, hand up, pair up and have students share their answers to the guiding question. (2 min) (Modeled)
2_LP2of7Notepad.txt: 4. Teacher will explain that students will be doing a quick walkabout to gain some “knowledge drops” about M.U.D.(Metropolitan Utilities District) and how it supports Omaha.

2_LP2of7Notepad.txt: 9. Once students have put their water cycle models together, they will continue working on their game boards. (Varies)
3_LP3of7Notepad.txt: 1. Teacher instructs students to meet in their small groups to record observations they observe within their water cycle models. Students have not received any vocabulary words or any direct instruction about the water cycle, so their observations will be informal. (5 min) (Modeled)
3_LP3of7Notepad.txt: 3. Formally introduce the key terms evaporation, condensation, precipitation, transpiration, crystallization, respiration, decomposition and groundwater. Students will need to model how to write a definition for students. Teacher will model using the words respiration and decomposition for students as they will not observe these within their models.  Ask students if they think they observed any of these terms in their model.  Are there any that aren’t? Why not?(5 min) (Modeled)
3_LP3of7Notepad.txt: 4. While still in their small groups students will try to form their own definitions of the key terms in their journals. They should use what they learned in the study jams video as well as what they observe in their models. (10 min) (Shared)
3_LP3of7Notepad.txt: 6. Teacher introduces expectations for participating in an academic conversation. Explain to students that when we have academic conversations we discuss science topics in a deeper way. While engaging in the conversation students will add their thinking using what they know and facts that they’ve learned. When we engage in an academic conversation we need to keep the following in mind (these may need to be elaborated on): (10 min) - take turns - stay on topic - express ideas clearly - listen actively - build on others’ comments/thinking - be respectful(i agree with/disagree with...because) - allow for wait time - be prepared (Modeled)
3_LP3of7Notepad.txt: 9. Explain that we are going to investigate how different materials that make up Earth’s surface can affect how water moves when it comes in contact with the ground. *Earth’s materials is a general term that includes minerals, rocks, soil, and water.

4_LP4of7Notepad.txt: 3. Explain to students that when liquid water evaporates it is turned into water vapor that then rises high into the atmosphere where it cools back down into water droplets. Eventually these water droplets combine to form clouds. Snow is a special kind of precipitation sometimes called crystallization. Crystallization is the process by which a substance becomes a solid, sort of like freezing. But in crystallization, crystals form. As clouds cool and condense they form rain or crystallize to form snow in a process called crystallization. Eventually these types of water are returned to the Earth via precipitation.  (5-7 min.)

5_LP5of7Notepad.txt: 5. Revisit with the class that during the last lesson they explored how some of the water that falls to the ground is collected underneath the Earth’s surface. Today we will explore what happens to water on the surface of the Earth and what causes those things to happen. Ask students the guiding question “How does the sun affect the dynamic nature of the water cycle? (Tomorrow we will have the same guiding question so it may not be answered completely today.) (5 min.) (Modeled)
5_LP5of7Notepad.txt: 8. Have students grab their water cycle models if they do not still have them from their initial observations. Explain that today we will add an additional component to our water cycle models and will explore who that affects the water cycle.

They will then place saran wrap, secured with a rubber band or tape,  over the top of the model. Next, they will place the bag of ice on top. Pass out desk lamps/heat lamps. Students will place their lamp in a way that it shines down onto the model as the sun would on Earth. Monitor what happens for the next 10 min. (15 min.) (Guided) 
5_LP5of7Notepad.txt: 9. Teacher will ask the students to observe what happens within their model when a heat source is added. While observing students will respond to the following questions in their notebooks. What was the energy source for the water cycle? How does the water cycle "transport" energy?

(5 min) (Modeled)
6_LP6of7Notepad.txt: 7. Teacher states the Phenomenon: You can get a fresh drink of water almost anywhere in the United States simply by turning on a faucet.  However, in many villages and cities around the world, people have to go a long way to find clean water that is safe to drink. Scientists have taken up the challenge of bringing water to these people through ancient method of collecting dew. Explain that dew is the moisture that condenses on surfaces as a result of cooling temperatures and the available humidity in the air. Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air. In rural villages across the world, people are putting up nets.  Cooler night temperatures cause moisture in the air from higher humidity or fog to condense and cover the nets with water.  The water drains into a container, providing a lifeline to thirsty communities. The water is safe for drinking, cooking, bathing, and tending crops. (5 min) (Modeled)
6_LP6of7Notepad.txt: 9. Formative Assessment: Students will add any missing pieces to their diagram. All vocabulary should be included and defined by the end of this lesson. (10 min)
