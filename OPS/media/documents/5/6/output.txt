Science and Engineering Practices:
1_1_LP1of7Notepad.txt: 2.  Teacher records student responses on the board to the guiding question. (Modeled)
1_1_LP1of7Notepad.txt: 4. Share with students that Omaha area receives their water from 3 sources: Missouri river, Platte river, and Dakota sandstone aquifer. An aquifer is an area underground that holds water in the gaps between rock, sand or gravel. Sort of like an underground lake or stream. Other parts of the state receive water from the Ogallala aquifer and other groundwater sources. (5 min). (Modeled)
1_1_LP1of7Notepad.txt: 5. Prompt students to think about if they’ve ever learned anything about the water cycle. In this unit we will be defining what our Earth’s water cycle does. (1-2 min) (Modeled)
1_1_LP1of7Notepad.txt: 6. Explain to students that over the course of the unit they will be working in small groups to develop a game about what they are learning about the water cycle. Each day groups will develop engaging questions based off of what they’ve learned that day. By the end of the unit each game will have at least 16 questions: 8 about the water on the local level and 8 about the water cycle on a global level. Today they will begin creating their game boards. Share different layouts from games in your classroom or look some up online. For example: Monopoly, Chutes and Ladders, Sorry!, etc. (10 min) (Modeled)
1_1_LP1of7Notepad.txt: 7. Students will receive time to work on their gameboard formats. (30 min) (Independent)
2_2_LP2of7Notepad.txt: 1. Ask students to consider the question: “How does the Missouri River, Platte River, and the Dakota Sandstone Aquifer maintain its water level if major cities like Omaha and Kansas City are constantly removing large amounts daily?” Use the Kagan activity stand up, hand up, pair up and have students share their answers to the guiding question. (2 min) (Modeled)
2_2_LP2of7Notepad.txt: 4. Teacher will explain that students will be doing a quick walkabout to gain some “knowledge drops” about M.U.D.(Metropolitan Utilities District) and how it supports Omaha. Explain to students that during the walkabout they will learn a lot of information. Their job is to take a post it note and a pencil and record the “knowledge drop” they found to be most interesting and why. (2-3 min) (Modeled)
2_2_LP2of7Notepad.txt: 6. Introduce that we will be learning about the water cycle. Today we will build a model that will mimic several parts of the water cycle. Over the course of the next few classes we will observe how the model mimics several parts of the water cycle. (2-3 min) (Modeled)
2_2_LP2of7Notepad.txt: 7. Teacher will divide students into ability groups of 3-4 students. Guide students through creating a model environment. (see eScience3000 Earth’s Waters Unit, Chapter 1-The Water Planet, Lesson 1: The Water Cycle Investigate tab for complete directions)  (30 min.) (Guided)
2_2_LP2of7Notepad.txt: 8. Students will respond on post-its or padlet what they think they will observe in the models they built. (5 min) 
2_2_LP2of7Notepad.txt: 9. Once students have put their water cycle models together, they will continue working on their game boards. (Varies)

Disciplinary Core Ideas:
1_1_LP1of7Notepad.txt: 1.  To generate interest in the topic, present the guiding question: “where does the water we use daily in Omaha come from?” (2-3 min) (Shared)
1_1_LP1of7Notepad.txt: 3.  Ask students if they would want to drink or use the water from the Missouri river. Ask students to turn and talk to their shoulder partner.  (Shared)

2_2_LP2of7Notepad.txt: 5. Students go on the walkabout and complete their post it leaving the post it underneath the “knowledge drop” they found most interesting. Students will do a “Did you Know?” walkabout with the following facts: Metropolitan Utilities District of Omaha serves more than 214,000 customers an average of about 90 million gallons of water per day. We also maintain 27,275 hydrants for fire protection. The average M.U.D. residential customer uses 85,000 gallons of water per year.  The cost for 85,000 gallons in 2017 is $362.42 including service fee, $4 infrastructure replacement charge and 2-percent payment to cities. (10 min.) (Independant)
